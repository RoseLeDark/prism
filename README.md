# PRISM ‚Äì Parallel Register Interface System Module

**PRISM** is a modular, hardware-oriented communication interface designed for efficient parallel data exchange between microcontrollers and clients. It focuses on high-speed transfer, clear abstraction layers, and extensibility through a registry system for SIMD-style operations.

This repository serves as the entry point and meta-project for all PRISM components, including protocol documentation, API headers, firmware, registry, and tooling.

## üîå Communication Protocol

PRISM communicates over I¬≤C and an 8-bit parallel data buffer. Up to 10 lines are used to bridge host and device(s):

- **I¬≤C**: Control channel (device address selection, broadcast at `0x51`)
- **Lines 1‚Äì4 + 7‚Äì10**: Parallel 8-bit data transfer
- **Line 5**: Data strobe (new data)
- **Line 6**: Entry control (combine/write modes)

PRISM supports multiple ESP32-based SIMD coprocessors working in parallel.

## üß∞ Client API Example

```cpp
_pridev device = prism_dev_hs(addr, Flankspeed);
_v256i a = prism_set1_ui32(0xABCD);
prism_write_v256a(a, device, portMaxTime);
prism_op_notc(device);
_v256i c = prism_read_v256c(device, timeout);
uint32_t result = prism_extract_ui32(c, 0);
```

Available operations include:

- `prism_set*` ‚Äì Input register manipulation
- `prism_op_*` ‚Äì Operation triggers
- `prism_add_*`, `prism_sub_*`, etc. ‚Äì Inline ALU-style commands
- `prism_extract_*` ‚Äì Result decoding

New functions can be registered via the Registry with vendor-specific suffixes.

## üß¨ PRISM Registry

The [`prism-registry`](https://github.com/RoseLeDark/prism-registry) defines:

- Function prototypes and naming conventions
- Required inputs/outputs, side effects, and examples
- Versioning and compatibility metadata
- Contribution rules for proposals

Each function must define behavior, advantages, and examples. Vendor-specific extensions (e.g. `_intel`, `_amd`) are supported.

---

## üõ† Arduino & Microcontroller Support

PRISM supports hobbyist and embedded systems via:

- [`prism-api-arduino`](https://github.com/RoseLeDark/prism-api-arduino): Arduino-compatible API bindings
- [`prism-api`](https://github.com/RoseLeDark/prism-api): C/C++ headers for AVR, STM32, ESP32, etc.

Works with `Wire` or custom I¬≤C implementations.
