# Prism Host Api
Header-only client API for PRISM SIMD integration (MPL-2.0)

**PRISM** is a modular, hardware-oriented communication interface designed for efficient parallel data exchange between microcontrollers and clients. It focuses on high-speed transfer, clear abstraction layers, and extensibility through a registry system for SIMD-style operations.
